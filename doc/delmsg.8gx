message_id\fP[,...]
.SH Description
\fBdelmsg\fP deletes messages from a store. This utility does not perform a
"surgical" operation on the SQLite database directly, but connects to an exmdb
server and issues the delete_messages RPC. This deletes not only messages, but
also updates the foloder structure for the sake of Cached Mode clients.
.PP
The folder and message IDs taken as arguments on the command-line should be
of the GC-value form, i.e. as they appear in the the SQLite database, though.
.SH Options

wastebasket; soft deletion sets a deleted flag and the mail stays in its folder
(albeit invisibly).
.TP
\fB\-u\fP \fIu@d.de\fP
Mailbox to operate on.
