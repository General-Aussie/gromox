.TH gromox\-mt2exm 8gx "" "Gromox" "Gromox admin reference"
.SH Name
gromox\-mt2exm \(em Utility for importing various mail items
.SH Synopsis
\fBgromox\-mt2exm\fP [\fB\-pt\fP] \fB-u\fP [\fIuser\fP]\fB@\fP\fIdomain.de\fP
.SH Description
gromox\-mt2exm reads a Gromox-specific mailbox transfer format data stream from
standard input as generated by gromox\-pff2mt(8gx) and writes folders and
messages included therein to a specific Gromox mail store.
.PP
Note that messages are always owned by the store they are in. Especially if
importing to a public store, you may need to set some additional permissions on
that public store's folders so that a particular user is able to modify
messages.
.SH Options
.TP
\fB\-p\fP
Show properties in detail (enhances \fB\-t\fP).
.TP
\fB\-t\fP
Print folder/message summary as these items are processed.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP [\fIuser\fP]\fB@\fIdomain.de\fP
Target mail store which to import mails to. For the public folder of a domain,
leave out the local part, i.e. use \fB@\fP\fIdomain.de\fP.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP
When importing an MT stream that does not request message splicing, mt2exm will
raise an error if a to-be-created folder already exists. This behavior can be
turned off with \-x. This option can be thought of what mkdir's \-p option
would do.
.SH Examples

.PP
gromox\-pff2mt sample.pst | gromox\-mt2exm \-u target@mailbox.de
.PP
PFF import to a public folder:
.PP
gromox\-pff2mt sample.pst | gromox\-mt2exm \-u @mailbox.de
