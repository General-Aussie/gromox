.SH Name
gromox\-mbop \(em Mailbox operations utility
.SH Synopsis
\fBgromox\-mbop\fP {\fB\-d\fP \fImbox\fP|\fB\-u\fP [\fIuser\fP]\fB@d.de\fP}
\fIcommand\fP [command-args...]
.SH Global options
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fI/var/lib/gromox/user/1/2\fP
Lookup the mailbox parameters from the associated filesystem location.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP [\fIuser\fP]\fB@example.com\fP
Lookup the mailbox parameters by the associated username. (To access a public
store of a domain, leave out the local part, i.e. use
\fB@\fP\fIexample.com\fP.)
.SH Commands
.IP \(bu 4
clear\-photo: delete user picture
.IP \(bu 4
clear\-profile: delete user's PHP-MAPI profile
.IP \(bu 4
delmsg: issue "delete_message" RPCs for a mailbox
.IP \(bu 4
purge\-datafiles: remove orphaned attachments/content files from disk
.IP \(bu 4
purge\-softdelete: remove soft-deleted items from a folder
.IP \(bu 4
unload: issue the "unload_store" RPC for a mailbox
.IP \(bu 4
vacuum: issue the "vacuum" RPC for a mailbox
.SH clear\-photo
The clear\-photo command will delete the user picture. Note that, when there is
no mailbox-level profile picture set, Gromox server processes may serve an
image from another source, e.g. LDAP.
.SH clear\-profile
Similar to MSMAPI, PHP-MAPI keeps a MAPI profile which contains a store list
and also the settings for grommunio-web. The clear\-profile command will delete
the copy of this data stored in exmdb. Note that zcore(8) may still hold a copy
of the MAPI profile in memory and could write that back to exmdb, nullifying
the effect of the clear\-profile command. Also, if the store list is absent,
a new one will implicitly be created when PHP-MAPI/zcore is used.
.SH delmsg
.SS Synopsis
\fBgromox\-mbop \-u\fP \fIa@b.de\fP \fBdelmsg \-f\fP \fIfolder_spec\fP
[\fImsgid\fP...]
.SS Description
This command hard-deletes messages from a store, including issuing proper
PR_CHANGE_KEY metadata updates for the sake of Cached Mode clients.
.PP
The folder and message IDs taken as arguments on the command-line should be
of the GC-value form, i.e. as they appear in the the SQLite database.
.SS Subcommand options
.TP
\fB-f\fP \fIfolder_spec\fP
The folder from which to delete the messages. See below for details. (If a
msgid is specified which is not located in the particular folder, that message
will not be deleted.)
.TP
\fB\-\-soft\fP
Perform a soft deletion.
.SH emptyfld
.SS Synopsis
\fBgromox\-mbop \-u\fP \fIa@b.de\fP \fBemptyfld\fP [\fB\-MRa\fP] [\fB\-\-soft\fP]
\fIfolder_spec\fP...
.SS Description
This command deletes messages from a folder.
.SS Subcommand options
.TP
\fB\-M\fP
Exempt normal messages from deletion.
.TP
\fB-R\fP
Besides messages, also delete subfolders.
.TP
\fB\-a\fP
Select associated messages (FAI) for deletion.
.TP
\fB\-\-soft\fP
Perform a soft deletion. (This feature is experimental.) Default is hard.
.SH purge\-datafiles
The "purge\-datafiles" RPC makes exmdb_provider remove attachment and content
files from disk that are no longer referenced by any message.
.SH purge\-softdelete
.SS Synopsis
\fBgromox\-mbop \-u\fP \fIa@b.de\fP \fBpurge-softdelete\fP [\fB\-r\fP]
[\fB\-t\fP \fItimespec\fP] \fIfolder_spec\fP...
.SS Description
This command removes all messages from a folder which are marked as
softdeleted. (The entire mailbox can be processed by specifying the root
folder plus the -r option.)
.SS Subcommand options
.TP
\fB-r\fP
Recurse into subfolders.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP \fItimespec\fP
Specifies the minimum age that soft-deleted messages must have before they are
hard-deleted. timespec can be something like \fI1d12h\fP. A number of units are
recognized (short and long forms): s/sec/second(s), min/minute(s), h/hour(s),
d/day(s), week(s), month(s), y/year(s).
.br
Default: \fI0\fP
.SH unload
Normally, exmdb_provider(4gx) keeps stores open for up to
exmdb_provider.cfg:cache_interval. The "unload_store" RPC to
exmdb_provider(4gx) causes the sqlite database (in
/var/lib/gromox/.../exmdb/exchange.sqlite3) to be closed. Any subsequent RPC
may reopen it, though. The unload RPC is useful after a mailbox was deleted
and/or reinitialized with grommunio-admin-api or tools like
gromox-mkprivate(8)/gromox-mkpublic(8). [zcore also has store state in memory.
This would also need to be purged \(em but there is no RPC for such action at
this time.] unload will fail to succeed if there is still a client connected to
the mailbox via a notification channel.
.SH vacuum
The "vacuum" RPC makes exmdb_provider issue the SQLite "vacuum" command on
exchange.sqlite3, which rebuilds and compacts the database file.
.SH Folder specification
\fIfolder_spec\fP can either be a numeric identifier, or a path-like
specification into the folder hierarchy. If the name starts with the slash
character '/', it is interpreted as starting from the root; otherwise, the
first component must be a special name (CALENDAR, COMMON_VIEWS, CONFLICTS,
CONTACTS, DEFERRED_ACTION, DELETED, DRAFT, FINDER, INBOX, IPM_SUBTREE, JOURNAL,
JUNK, LOCAL_FAILURES, NOTES, OUTBOX, SENT, SERVER_FAILURES, SHORTCUTS,
SYNC_ISSUES, TASKS, VIEWS). These special names can be used with private stores
only; there are no names defined for public folder contents at this time. There
is also no parsing support for slashes in folder names currently in mbop; the
slash character is always treated as a hierarchy separator. Examples:
.IP \(bu 4
/Top of Information Store/Sent Items/2022
.IP \(bu 4
IPM_SUBTREE/Sent Items/2022
.IP \(bu 4
SENT/2022
