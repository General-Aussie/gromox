.TH midb_agent 4gx "" "Gromox" "Gromox admin reference"
.SH Synopsis
.PP
midb_agent \(em plugin that offers a midb(8gx) client with a C API
.SH Configuration file directives
.SS connection_num
.PP
The number of connections to keep open towards every midb target.
.PP
Default: \fI5\fP
.SS context_average_mem
.PP
Enables and sets the size of a memory pool (in object count; the actual size is
256 bytes * context_num * context_average_mem). imap(8gx) and pop3(8gx) require
this to be non-zero for full functionality.
.PP
Default: \fI1024\fP
.SH Multiserver map
.PP
The SQL column \fBusers.homedir\fP specifies a home directory location in an
abstract namespace. This abstract namespace is shared between all Gromox
programs, and can be used to divide users into custom subsets and steer
connections to different servers.
.PP
midb_list.txt specifies how to map from this namespace to midb servers.
Each line in this file consists of 3 columns separated by whitespace:
.IP \(bu 4
String used for prefix-matching a home directory location.
.IP \(bu 4
The IPv6 (or v4-mapped) address of the midb server to use for this prefix.
.IP \(bu 4
The port number.
.SH Files
.IP \(bu 4
\fIconfig_file_path\fP/\fIinstance\fP.cfg: configuration file for the instance
of midb_agent. (Instace is usually \fBmidb_agent\fP, as there is not much point
in loading midb_agent twice.)
.IP \(bu 4
\fIconfig_file_path\fP/midb_list.txt: midb multiserver map
.PP
\fIconfig_file_path\fP is determined by the configuration of the program that
loaded the midb_agent plugin.
