.TH authmgr 4gx "" "Gromox" "Gromox admin reference"
.SH Description
.PP
authmgr is a service plugin that, for mail account authentication, dynamically
selects the authentication backend per user account. The
libgxsvc_mysql_adaptor.so and/or libgxsvc_ldap_adaptor.so plugins need to be
loaded in advance (this is the case by default).
.SH Configuration file directives
.SS auth_backend_selection
.PP
This controls how authmgr picks the backend. Once \fBalways_ldap\fP or
\fBexternid\fP is set, ldap_adaptor(4gx) becomes mandatory, as does its
configuration, i.e. LDAP search base and access credentials need to be valid.

Available: \fIalways_mysql\fP, \fIalways_ldap\fP, \fIexternid\fP
