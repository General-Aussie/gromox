.SH Description
.PP
localemap is a service plugin that reads the character set and locale maps into
memory and offers lookups in them.
.PP
It is vital that localemap is able to load the text files and initialize the
mappings, as otherwise, character set conversions cannot be performed and e.g.
exchange_nsp(4gx) responds with failure to RPCs made by Outlook that involve
character set IDs or locale IDs.
