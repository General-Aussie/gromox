Gromox is a groupware server capable of serving as a replacement for Microsoft
Exchange. Connectivity options include Outlook Anywhere (RPC-over-HTTP),
IMAP/POP3, an SMTP-speaking LDA, and a PHP module with a Z-MAPI function
subset. Gromox is preferably used in conjunction with a proven httpd, MTA and
spam solution (e.g. nginx, Postfix, rspamd) to form a comprehensive mail
system.
