#	regexp => \1xxx\2xxx\3\xxx..., maximum 9 replacement strings
# Subexpression is between \( and \), and you can refer to it with \n both in expression and 
# replace pattern, where n is the number of subexpression, like in \1. Remember about *, that
# that regular expression is evaluated from left to right, so the construct like a* must follow
# some other characters, and cannot be in the beginning of the expression, because * means none
# or more, and construct like a* alone doesn't determine any particular place. in replacement
# string \0 means all string
